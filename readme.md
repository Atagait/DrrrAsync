DrrrAsync is a Client/Bot framework for a Drrr.com, a 'DOLLARS' style chatsite inspired by the anime Durarara.

The structure of DrrrAsync's 'Bot' class is very similar DSharpPlus to maximize compatibility of modules and functions.
For the most part, any functions you write for your discord bot, are easily portable to DrrrAsync.
